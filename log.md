###Day 3: September 4, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**:

Completed first freecodecamp project. Tribute page. 
Started breaking down the next project down into smaller elements (Personal portfolio page) 
Identified some documentation to start digging into tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Next project seems to go beyond topics covered by freecodecamp so far. So I suspect Plenty of searching, asking, documentation, and note making ahead.
